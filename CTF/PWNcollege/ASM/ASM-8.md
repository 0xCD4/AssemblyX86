## Level 8 - Bitwise AND and Pointer Calculation (Explanation)

In this challenge, we are given the values of `rdi` and `rsi`, and we need to perform a bitwise AND operation between `rdi` and `rsi`, and then store the result in `rax`. Additionally, we need to set `rax` to a pointer address that points to the result.

### Given Data

The value of `rdi` is: `0x5856eabd47a76de7`

The value of `rsi` is: `0x823480e58837da98`

### Solution Steps

1. We perform a bitwise AND operation between `rdi` and `rsi` using the `and rsi, rdi` instruction. The result of the AND operation will be stored in `rsi`.

   - Before: `rsi = 0x5856eabd47a76de7`
   - Before: `rdi = 0x823480e58837da98`
   - After: `rsi = 0x01120a4284201150`

2. We set `rax` to a pointer address that points to the result stored in `rsi`. This is achieved using the `lea rax, [rsi+0]` instruction.

   - `lea rax, [rsi+0]` calculates the effective address `[rsi+0]`, which is equivalent to the value in `rsi` itself. Thus, `rax` now contains the pointer address to the value `0x01120a4284201150`.

### Final Result

After executing the provided code, the `rax` register will hold the value `0x01120a4284201150`, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the given `rdi` and `rsi` values. Additionally, `rax` is set to a pointer address that points to this result.

### Explanation in Assembly Code

```assembly
and rsi, rdi    ; Perform a bitwise AND operation between rdi and rsi, storing the result in rsi
lea rax, [rsi]  ; Set rax to a pointer address that points to the value in rsi
```


The value in the `rax` register after executing the provided code is `0x01120a4284201150`. The final flag can be derived from this result.
