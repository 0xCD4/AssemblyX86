# ASMLevel19 Solution

To interact with this level, you will send raw bytes over stdin to the program. First, run it once to see the requirements, and then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

In this level, you'll be working with control flow manipulation using instructions like `jmp`, `call`, `cmp`, and more, to implement requested behavior.

You'll be tested multiple times in this level with dynamic values, running your code with different inputs to ensure its robustness for normal use.

## Indirect Jump and Switch Statements

The challenge introduces indirect jumps, often used for switch statements in real-world programming. A switch statement is a special case of an if-statement that uses numbers to determine control flow. In x86 assembly, you can achieve similar behavior based on exact numbers or known ranges.

A jump table is a contiguous section of memory holding addresses to jump to. Instead of multiple `cmp` instructions, we can use a jump table to minimize comparisons. For example:


[0x1337] = address of do_thing_0
[0x1337+0x8] = address of do_thing_1
...
jmp [jump_table_address + number * 8]


## Implementing the Logic

Implement the following logic using the provided constraints:

```csharp
if rdi is 0:
    jmp 0x403026
else if rdi is 1:
    jmp 0x403126
else if rdi is 2:
    jmp 0x403194
else if rdi is 3:
    jmp 0x403272
else:
    jmp 0x403323
```

# Solution

```assembly
cmp rdi, 3
jle great
lea rax, [rsi + 0x18]
jmp [rax]
great:
lea rax, [rsi + rdi * 8]
jmp [rax]
int3
```

# Python code to send the assembly to the program
process.write(pwn.asm("""
    cmp rdi, 3
    jle great
    lea rax, [rsi + 0x18]
    jmp [rax]
great:
lea rax, [rsi + rdi * 8]
jmp [rax]
int3
"""
))


Absolutely, I'll provide a more detailed explanation of the solution for ASMLevel19:

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with implementing conditional control flow using x86 assembly instructions. You are given a specific set of conditions and constraints to follow. You must use instructions like `jmp`, `cmp`, and others to implement a switch-like structure based on the value of `rdi`.

## Switch Statements and Jump Tables

Switch statements in programming allow you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable. In x86 assembly, you can achieve similar behavior using jump tables. A jump table is a list of memory addresses that correspond to different cases. You can use arithmetic operations to calculate the address to jump to based on the input value.

## Solution Breakdown

The solution for ASMLevel19 follows these steps:

1. Compare `rdi` with 3: 
   ```assembly
   cmp rdi, 3
   ```

2. If `rdi` is less than or equal to 3, jump to the `great` label. Otherwise, calculate the jump address for the default case:
   ```assembly
   jle great
   lea rax, [rsi + 0x18]  ; Calculate address of default case
   jmp [rax]              ; Jump to default case
   ```

3. For cases where `rdi` is less than or equal to 3, calculate the address of the corresponding case using a jump table:
   ```assembly
   great:
   lea rax, [rsi + rdi * 8]  ; Calculate address of the specific case
   jmp [rax]                  ; Jump to the specific case
   ```

4. The `int3` instruction is added as a placeholder for debugging or analysis purposes.

## Python Code

The provided Python code demonstrates how to use the assembly solution. The `pwn.asm()` function is used to assemble the given assembly code into raw bytes and then sent to the program for execution.

## Conclusion

The detailed breakdown provided above should help you understand how the solution works step by step. It leverages the concept of indirect jumps and jump tables to efficiently implement a switch-like structure in x86 assembly based on the input value. This solution adheres to the constraints provided in the challenge and should help you successfully complete ASMLevel19.
